# Code-Quiz
This quiz will test your movie knowledge! Give it a whirl and see if you know your stuff # Random-Password-Generator

This project is intended to create a dynamic quiz using Javascript in which a person can test their knowledge about movies

## Technology

HTML and Javascript -- the CSS document is there for moral support
​​
## Installation

To install this code, pull the files from the repository https://github.com/kddayhoff/Code-Quiz
​
## Usage 
​
In order to ensure this code can be viewed correctly, it must be viewed in a web browser, ideally Google Chrome as it has the best compatibility. You can do this using the following link: https://github.com/kddayhoff/Code-Quiz. The quiz will start once the "Start Button" is clicked. The user will have 60 seconds to answer all of the questions correctly. If a user answers wrong, 15 seconds will be removed from the time clock, if it is right, 10 seconds will be added. Note: The time function is not working at this moment and will not increment time and a person is not able to store their initials with their high score...yet.

## Credits
​
All the classmates of VU Coding Bootcamp --particularly Tim and Sammantha, the TA's Terrance Mahnken, Pete Wanca, and the instructor Alec Downs. Seriously though.

Feel free to make this better. It's like Thoreau's <i>Walden</i>, nothing is original. Take an axe for example, you're not going to reinvent the axe. However, you can always leave it sharper than when you found it.
