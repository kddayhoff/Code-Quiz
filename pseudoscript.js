//DON'T HARD CODE IN HTML! PUT THINGS INTO VARIABLES! STRINGS OBJECTS! Make everything dynamic through HTML, looks aren't important - it's what's on the inside that counts
//CREATE ELEMENT!!!

//add push array to count how many right answers there (if true push to new arraw which will output on to page
//will need to use local storage to save initials to page, jSon.parse will help avoid listing out each letter when putting on page, need to take list, it's an array (obj w/ scores) that are strings, getItemfrom local storage -- need to use for loop to turn it back into an array
//'return' ex return a + b to show answer (return wrong/right)
